            While considering an alliance, most conservative families would match horoscopes. The parents do the thinking
            of whether the two families get along well with each other, whether socio-economic conditions, religious
            interests are similar etc... The parents ascertain the nature and habits of the boy/girl in consideration to
            an extent that they possibly can. The boy and the girl get to meet each other a few of times for a few hours
            each and are expected to judge the other person and come to a decision.
            <br><br>
            If a relative or a family friend brings the alliance, that person would paint a picture about
            the family, the boy/girl etc... which might or might not be the reality. If the alliance comes from a matrimonial
            website, it is completely up to the boy/girl and the parents to assess the match of the proposal.

            <b>There is a need for someone to facilitate conversations and elicit information that can serve
            as a basis for decision making.</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>Enter Spouzee!</b>
            <br><br>
            At Spouzee, we prompt our users to think in depth about what they bring to the table in the marriage and what
            they expect from the other person. We do this through a series of questions - each user creates a questionnaire
            through which they express what they expect, and answers a set of questions through which they call out what can
            be expected from them.
            <br><br>
            In order to facilitate meaningful exchanges, we provide a comprehensive set of questions covering many aspects
            of marriage and life thereafter. Some questions are direct while others are scenario based, so that you know how
            the person might respond to various situations. You can create your own questions/scenarios as well - we will
            present these along with the other questions/scenarios to prospective matches, so that you have all the data you
            need when it is time to make a decision.
            <br><br>
            All your answers are part of your public profile and will be visible to the users that we match you with (We do not
            allow random browsing of profiles, so you can rest assured) while your expectations are known only to us - so
            you can shed all your inhibitions and be very frank with your expectations!
            <br><br>
            <b>In short, we help you set and have the right expectations as you get into a relationship and we believe that's the
            recipe for happiness ever after!</b>
