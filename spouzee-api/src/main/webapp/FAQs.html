                <b>Why should I use Spouzee?</b></font>
                <br>
                <font size="2">Marital discord is on the rise in our society. Divorces are not uncommon anymore, while dysfunctional marriages
                are everywhere to be seen. Mismatch in expectations is the root of all marital problems. Spouzee is an attempt
                to bridge this gap by getting our users to clearly state their expectations and perspectives on various aspects
                of life upfront. This data can then be used to have more meaningful, realistic conversations when two people
                decide to talk at a personal level.<br>In other words, we help you find your true "soulmate" :)

                <br><br>
            <font color="#1e8eb8" size="2"><b>It's not like people marry blindly... They do talk before marriage. What are you gonna do there?</b></font>
                <br>
            <font size="2">Sure, the boy and the girl get to talk to each other a few times before marriage. But there are some systemic
                problems here. They would not have the visibility to the issues that might crop up after marriage, or the
                matters about which they need to be on the same page in order to take it forward. Add to it the excitement
                of getting married, shyness, wanting to impress, the awkwardness of talking personal matters with a stranger,
                the dilemma of wanting to know but inability to ask personal details etc... some help would actually help :)

            <font color="#1e8eb8" size="2"><b>How can I be sure that the answers of a person on Spouzee indeed reflect the real nature of the person?
                He/she might not have been serious while answering the questionnaire, or might just be lying...</b></font>
                <br>
            <font size="2">We have checks and balances to take care of scenarios like these, and we are not gonna give you details...
                you know why ;) On the other hand, while we make honest attempts to help you find the right person to spend
                your life with, the final decision is yours - if you decide to go ahead and talk to someone at a personal level,
                base your conversations with that person on his/her answers on Spouzee, but use your judgement to come to
                conclusions.<br>
                Also, if at any point you find/feel that a profile is not genuine, report it to us, we will take corrective
                measures.

            <font color="#1e8eb8" size="2"><b>What if the questions get too personal? I don't want to pour my heart out to strangers!</b></font>
            <br>
            <font size="2">The questions are either created by the team at Spouzee or submitted by our users. In either case,
                we moderate all the questions that enter our system to make our users feel comfortable.<br>
                But we understand it would be meaningless to discuss a (potential) marriage proposal without asking or revealing
                personal information to some extent. So your identity is not revealed to your matches without your approval.
                What this means is that your matches can view your answers and even interact with you over scenarios, but they would
                not know who you are unless you decide to reveal yourself.<br>
                If you are still not comfortable with a question, feel free to skip that question and go to the next one.

            <font color="#1e8eb8" size="2"><b>Are my personal details safe with Spouzee?</b></font>
                <br>
            <font size="2">Yes. We disclose email IDs of two users to each other <b>only</b> when they consent to it after going through
                each other's profiles which include basic information and their responses to the questionnaire. Further,
                we do not allow random browsing of profiles on Spouzee. If you are seeing the profile of someone on Spouzee,
                it is because we felt you might be interested - based on your expectations and responses. We require you to
                login with Facebook to save ourselves from verifying your email (and to save you from remembering another password;))
                - We will not post anything on Facebook as you, you can trust us on this.
